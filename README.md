# neural-network-daily

This is a web interaction for middle school students to learn about Neural Networks through images. Students will understand the concepts of input nodes, hidden layers, backpropagation and feedback. 

This project is in development.
# Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mitmedialab/neural-network-daily.git # clone the repo
cd neural-network-daily # change into root directory
npm run setup # install project dependencies
npm run dev # start development server 
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:______

### Development Server

# How to deploy

In your production environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mitmedialab/neural-network-daily.git # clone the repo
cd neural-network-daily # change into root directory
npm run setup # install project dependencies
npm run production # start the production server 
```

Alternatively, 

```bash
# instructions to build locally and copy the build to the server and run things there
```

# Why Svelte


# Why SvelteKit

This app is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), which is a framework<sup>1</sup> for designing full-blown apps written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). So by using SvelteKit, we get all the ease of developing components with Svelte (see [Why Svelte](#why-svelte)), while also getting access to things like [file-system based routing](), [server side rendering](), and other complicated, modern web development practices that we *shouldn't* have to care about. If you're familiar with Next.js, SvelteKit is for Svelte applications what Next.js is for React-based applications. 

><sup>1</sup> Framework in this case doesn't mean that it'll effect the code we write (i.e. we won't have to 'import SvelteKit' anywhere), but instead it prescribes how we should organize our files and requires a configuration step that manages bundling & wiring our app together. In short, the code is written using Svelte, and it is made deployable by SvelteKit.
